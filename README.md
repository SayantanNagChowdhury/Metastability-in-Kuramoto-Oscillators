The file `kuramoto_3subplots_N20` is for a system with N=20 oscillators, while the file `kuramoto_3subplots_N200` is for a system with N=200 oscillators.
N=200.gif contains the full simulation used to generate the snapshots shown in the manuscript for N=200 oscillators.
N=20.gif shows the simulation video from which the manuscript snapshots for the N=20 oscillator case are extracted.
All snapshots appearing in the manuscript are included here for reference.
